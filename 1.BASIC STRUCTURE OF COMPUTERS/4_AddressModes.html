        <ul>
            <li>Immediate: The operand is specified directly in the instruction itself.</li>
            <li>Register: The operand is stored in a CPU register.</li>
            <li>Direct: The operand is the memory address of the data.</li>
            <li>Indirect: The operand is a memory address, and the actual operand is found at that address.</li>
            <li>Indexed: The operand is obtained by adding a constant value or the content of another register to a base address.</li>
            <li>Base-Relative: Similar to indexed addressing, but the base address is stored in a register.</li>
            <li>Stack: Special addressing mode for operations involving the stack pointer register (SP).</li>
        </ul>
