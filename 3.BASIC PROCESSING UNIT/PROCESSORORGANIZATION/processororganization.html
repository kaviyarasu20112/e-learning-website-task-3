    <h1>Elements of a Processor</h1>

    <p>The processor, also known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), is the brain of a computer. Here's a breakdown of its organization along with a diagram for better understanding:</p>

    <h2>Components of a Processor</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> The brain of the CPU, it fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and directs other parts of the CPU to carry out those instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs all the mathematical and logical operations based on the instructions received from the CU.</li>
        <li><strong>Registers:</strong> These are small, high-speed memory locations that hold data and instructions currently being processed by the ALU and CU. There are different types of registers, each with a specific purpose:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accumulator (ACC):</strong> Stores the result of the most recent ALU operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Address Register (MAR):</strong> Holds the memory address from which data needs to be fetched or to which data needs to be written.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Data Register (MDR):</strong> Acts as a temporary storage location for data being transferred between the CPU and main memory.</li>
                <li><strong>General Purpose Registers (GPRs):</strong> A set of versatile registers that can store various kinds of data for temporary use during program execution.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cache:</strong> A small, fast memory that stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing.</li>
    </ul>
