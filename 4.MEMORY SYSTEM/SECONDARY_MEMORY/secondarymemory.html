    <h1>SECONDARY MEMORY</h1>

    <h2>Explanation of Secondary Memory and Its Types</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Secondary memory, also known as auxiliary or external memory, is a type of non-volatile storage used in computers to store data persistently even when the power is turned off.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Secondary memory serves as a long-term storage solution for large amounts of data that doesn't need to be accessed as frequently as primary memory (RAM). It complements primary memory by providing additional storage capacity.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Examples of Secondary Memory:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):</strong> HDDs use magnetic storage to store data on spinning disks. They offer high capacity at a relatively low cost but are slower in terms of read and write speeds compared to SSDs.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Solid-State Drives (SSDs):</strong> SSDs use flash memory to store data, providing faster read and write speeds compared to HDDs. They are more expensive but offer better performance and durability.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Optical Disks:</strong> Optical disks like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs use laser technology to read and write data. They are known for their durability and longevity, making them suitable for archival purposes.</li>
      
      <li><strong>USB Flash Drives:</strong> USB flash drives, also known as thumb drives or pen drives, are portable storage devices that use flash memory. They offer convenience and portability for transferring data between devices.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Magnetic Tapes:</strong> Although less common in consumer computing, magnetic tapes are still used in enterprise environments for their high capacity and cost-effectiveness in long-term data storage and backup solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-volatile:</strong> Secondary memory retains data even when the power is turned off.</li>
      <li><strong>High Capacity:</strong> Secondary memory devices typically offer high storage capacity, allowing users to store large amounts of data.</li>
      <li><strong>Varied Speeds:</strong> Different types of secondary memory have varying read and write speeds, with SSDs generally offering faster performance compared to HDDs.</li>
      <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Some secondary memory devices like USB flash drives are portable and can be easily carried around for data transfer between devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Secondary memory is used for storing various types of data, including operating systems, software applications, documents, multimedia files, and backups. It provides a reliable and scalable storage solution for both personal and enterprise computing environments.</li>
